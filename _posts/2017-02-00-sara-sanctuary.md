    As a technical advisor for SARA Sanctuary, I assist with various aspects of their technology infrastructure. This includes vendor management, network setup, and the development of their website. My work has helped expand the sanctuaryâ€™s digital reach, enabling more efficient operations and increased visibility for their mission. I continue to support their technology needs and will for as long as they are around.
