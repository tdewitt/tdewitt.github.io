description: >
    I was introduced to Siden through a mutual connection with one of the founders. Over a three-month period, I engaged with leadership and engineering to provide strategic guidance on SRE practices, DevOps models, and microservice architecture. In August 2019, I officially joined as Principal SRE, eventually taking on the role of Head of SRE. I collaborated with product engineering teams to streamline operational efficiency across the Software Development Lifecycle. This included leading a company-wide revamp of CI/CD practices and authoring key security policies to ensure development processes integrated robust security standards from the ground up.
