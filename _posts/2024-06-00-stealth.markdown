description: >
    Iâ€™m currently advising a pre-seed startup that is evolving an internal project at a well-known SaaS company into an open-source initiative. The project is licensed to allow commercial use with restrictions, ensuring a balance between open-source flexibility and controlled usage. The founders, having worked with me previously, reached out to have me design their core infrastructure to streamline SOC 2 compliance. This proactive approach enables them to move quickly in the space without the need for retrofitting compliance controls or cloud best practices later.
