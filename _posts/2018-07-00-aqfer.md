description: >
    I was initially brought into Aqfer by a seed investor to build and lead an SRE team in Chennai. After successfully hiring the team, my focus shifted to advising engineering leadership on reliability practices and reviewing product infrastructure plans. With the product launched and the team in place, I spearheaded the SOC 2 compliance efforts, acting as a liaison between engineers, SOC 2 consultants, and auditors. I also authored company-wide security, engineering, and incident management policies. After completing SOC 2 Type II, I reduced my engagement, maintaining a quarterly advisory role to ensure ongoing compliance rituals.
