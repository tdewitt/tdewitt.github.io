description: >
    I began informally advising Planera in mid-2022, working with their engineering leadership—two of whom were former colleagues from Siden—to help design and launch their product infrastructure. Officially engaged in April 2024, I was brought on to guide them through SOC 2 compliance. I worked closely with the team to establish controls, author policies, and ensure compliance readiness. Planera is now funded through a Series A, and I continue to play a key role in shaping their infrastructure and compliance strategies.
